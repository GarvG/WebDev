        <h4>Tips to avoid financial problems</h4>
        <p id="content-details">There is more to life than money. Even if you win the lottery, you will not be happier
            in the end. A lot of research has already been done on this. Winning the lottery gives you happiness for a
            short time, but not in the long run.
            Money and things are a way to show our status. But does all that stuff really give us status? What is your
            opinion about people who own more than you? In life, there are more important things than money and
            possessions. Happiness is not for sale.
            So how can we become happier and more satisfied? How can you experience more peace and tranquility in your
            life?</p>
